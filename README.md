For this App, I grabbed the stats from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ . I converted the stats of some of the best statistical seasons players have had over the last 30 years (plus Larry Bird's 1986 season) into a CSV, and then used that data to compare a random stat from the two different random player seasons when the "Jump Ball" is clicked. 

I have always loved basketball and got even more obsessed with it during COVID lockdown, after watching the "Last Dance" Michael Jordan documentary, so this was a bit of a passion project for me.
